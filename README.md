# My Portfolio
## Bio: 
My name is Alma, I have never worked with software development until 6 months ago when I started a coding for women boot camp. I have learned how to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Web development is very detail oriented, there are a lot of factors that go in to creating a functioning and safe website.
